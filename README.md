# PRODIGY_ML_02
Prodigy Machine Learning Internship Task 02
## Overview

This repository contains Python code for performing K-means clustering on customer data. K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning data into a predefined number of clusters based on similarity.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:
```bash
 pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone ``` https://github.com/priyankav-27/PRODIGY_ML_02.git ```
  
2. Navigate to the directory:
   cd kmeans-clustering

3. Open and run the Python script `mall customers.ipynb` in your preferred Python environment.

## Implementation Details

The code in `mall customers.ipynb` implements the K-means clustering algorithm using scikit-learn's `KMeans` class. Here's an overview of the implementation:

1. Load customer data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Preprocess the data, selecting relevant features and handling any missing values.
3. Initialize and fit the KMeans model to the data.
4. Get cluster labels assigned to each data point.
5. Visualize the clustering result using matplotlib.

## Results

After applying K-means clustering to the customer data, we obtained cluster labels for each data point. These cluster labels represent the group to which each customer belongs. The clustering results allow us to segment the customers based on their purchasing behavior, which can provide valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and customer segmentation.
